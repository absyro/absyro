        <p>Absyro (Advanced Breakthrough Software Systems & Robotics Operations) was founded in 2023 by Amir Farzamnia, Absyro is a technology company dedicated to creating next-generation technologies. Our mission is to solve problems and enhance everyday life with our unique and innovative solutions.</p>
        <p>Our journey began with the creation of <a class="text-teal-400 hover:underline" href="https://botstudioo.com">Bot Studio</a>, a service for building robots. This marked the birth of Absyro - a company committed to developing unique products and services.</p>
        <p>We believe in accessibility and inclusivity. That's why most of our products and services are free to use, with optional low-cost items available for purchase. We do not restrict access based on location, gender, age, or financial status.</p>
        <p>At Absyro, we support the growth of the global tech community by making most of our products and services open-source. While some may initially be closed due to security and marketing considerations, we aim to make all our products open-source over time.</p>
        <p>All our open-source projects can be found on <a class="text-teal-400 hover:underline" href="https://github.com/absyro">Absyro's GitHub</a> page. The licensing for these projects varies based on our discretion.</p>
        <p>Absyro is more than just a brand - it's a community powered by people. We're proud to give back by donating a portion of our income to charitable causes.</p>
