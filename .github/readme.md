# Absyro Project Setup

Welcome to this project! Follow these simple steps to set up and get started with the project.

## Installation

To begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development Server

During the development phase, you can take advantage of the live-reloading feature. Run the following command to compile and hot-reload your project:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will launch a development server, and any changes you make to your code will be reflected instantly.

## Production Build

When you are ready to deploy your application, use the following command to compile and minify your project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate optimized and compressed files in the 'dist' directory, ready for deployment.
